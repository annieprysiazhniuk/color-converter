<p>Are you curious about RGB and Hex color formats? RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is a color model that
                    represents colors by mixing different intensities of red, green, and blue light. Each component can
                    have values ranging from 0 to 255, resulting in over 16 million possible color combinations. </p>
<p>On the
                    other hand, Hex (Hexadecimal) is a numerical representation of colors using a combination of six
                    alphanumeric characters. It is widely used in web design and development. Hex values consist of a
                    hashtag (#) followed by six characters, with each pair representing the intensity of red, green, and
                    blue using hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F). </p>
